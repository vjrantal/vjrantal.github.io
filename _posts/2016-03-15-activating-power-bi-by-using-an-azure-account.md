The beef of this blog post is the video screencast above that shows three things:

  1. Creating an Azure account (starting at 0:00)
  2. Creating an organizational account (starting at 1:12)
  3. Activating Power BI (starting at 6:51)

Once you have access to Power BI, you can play around with the features it offers. For example, you can use it to visualize sensor data in realtime like done [here](http://thinglabs.io/workshop/js/weather/) or [here](https://blogs.microsoft.com/iot/2015/05/05/monitoring-sensors-with-power-bi/).

In the video, I created a free trial Azure account, but you can also use an existing Azure account if you have one, for example, as an MSDN benefit. In that case, just skip step 1. and only complete steps 2. and 3.
